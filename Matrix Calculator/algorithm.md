# general overview / postgame report
this program will be a matrix calculator where you will be able to add, subtract, and multiply all types of matricies. this will take inputs for the rows and columns of the matricies and be able to add, subtract, or multiply the matrix depending on the users wants. I was hoping to do much more with this program but was unable to do so because I ran out of time and will power. I tried my best on this assignment and gave it everything I learned this semester if not more than I did haha. These past two weeks of working on this, It felt like an actual experience I would probably go through in an actaully job. I knew what I wanted and I took it step by step with the uml file then the algorithm and then creating the entire program in one file and then of course splitting into classes and objects (which is a lot harder when you try to do it alone!!). That last step had me stuck for days where I just continued to watch your leactures to evetually get it! This project was fun and although this program is not all the way complete, I know I gave it my all and that I am walking away from this class a long smarter and a better prgrammer than I was when I first came into this class.

# main.cpp
this main file has a start menu that will be displayed to the user and by using cases, the user will be prompted to their next destination. This may the the addition, subtraction, or the multiplication function. Each function will take in the integer for the number of rows and columns in each of its matricies and ensure that the operation is possible. It will then take the values for each position in the matrix and store them using 2D arrays. the array will then be printed and then the arrays will then be sent to the operator that adds, subtracts, or multlpies for the math to be appiled to the arrays. The main function will then print the final matrix.

# matrix.h 
this header file will have int values for the rows and columns of the matricies and also have an array for the storage of the values within the array. It will also have a constructor and deconstructor, to prevent any memory leaks. it will have a make matrix function that creates the matrix off of the 2D array. it will also have an operator individual to each addition, subtraction, and multiplication. these will them prompt the arrays to the output operator that will display the matrix as  matrix in the rows and columns it should be in.

# matrix.cpp
the constructor will define the variables used for the rows and columns along with the pointer to the pointer of the so that each row has a seperate 2D array for its row. These will are be deleted in the deconstructor to prevent any type of memory leakage. The make matrix function will take the inputs of the user to store the inputs into the arrays. the math operators will take the arrays and place them into temp values to add the and give the new values the placements of the variables. the outstream operator will take in the values of the array and print them as matricies.
